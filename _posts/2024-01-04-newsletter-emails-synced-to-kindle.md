# How to send Substack posts straight to your Kindle using Google App Scripts

Last year a friend of mine gifted me an old Kindle. I never quite made the jump to reading books on it, since my "to read" pile was already pretty large and physically sitting on my shelves and the shelves of my nearby library. But, I found myself wishing I could use it to read the [Substack](https://substack.com/) newsletters I had been devouring from my tiny phone screen. If I could automatically sync those to the Kindle I'd have a physical, book-ish object on which to read all those lovely essays!

I took a break from the idea, but came back to it recently and built out a working solution in a weekend, using [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script), [Send to Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/email), and a bit of HTML munging.

When I did an initial search to see what support already existed for this problem I came across [Readbetter](https://www.readbetter.io/), which pretty much does exactly what I want. Unfortunately, I was quickly hitting the 3 article / month maximum on the free tier, and $7 a month was more than I wanted to pay for something long into the future when I felt I could build my own version as a fun weekend project. If you're less interested in building out your own solution, Readbetter might be exactly the right fit.



and found that I could manually send Substacks to my Kindle by turning an essay into a PDF and emailing it to my [Send to Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/email) email. Forwarding the Substack emails directly to the same email didn't always work for me. I also found that someone had already solved this problem by building , but
