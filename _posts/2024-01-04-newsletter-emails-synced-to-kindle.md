# How to send Substack posts straight to your Kindle using Google App Scripts

Last year a friend of mine gifted me an old Kindle. I never quite made the jump to reading books on it -- my "to read" pile was already pretty large and physically present, sitting on my shelves and the shelves of my nearby library -- but, I had been an avid reader of a couple Substack newsletters, and found myself wishing the Kindle could automatically sync those. Then I would have a physical, book-ish object on which to read all those lovely essays!

## Existing Solutions and Infrastructure

I did an initial search to see what support for this already existed and found that I could manually send Substacks to my Kindle by turning an essay into a PDF and emailing it to my [Send to Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/email) email. Forwarding the Substack emails directly to the same email didn't always work for me. I also found that someone had already solved this problem by building [Readbetter](https://www.readbetter.io/), but I was quickly hitting the 3 article / month maximum on the free tier, and $7 a month was more than I wanted to pay for something that I felt I could build as a fun weekend project.
